# Movie_Recommender_System
This project uses the technique of Item-based Collaborative Filtering to make movie recommendations based on users' past ratings of movies.
This project uses movie rating data from MovieLens (http://movielens.org), a movie recommendation service. The data is collected and made available by GroupLens Research (https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
